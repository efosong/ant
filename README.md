An ant colony optimization implementation.

This is my ant colony optimization program. There are many like it, but this one is mine. 
I designed the algorithm myself (I love a challenge), after watching a youtube video about ACOs, so if it is horribly inefficient, that is why.

-> 24/09/2014: The ACO has been programmed, but not yet uploaded due to my dubiousness on the effectiveness of my implementation. About 50% of the time, it will find the shortest path, although it often seems to never converge at all. Maybe I need to play around with the parameters a bit, to find a sweet spot for the graph I have [unfortunately] hardcoded in.
